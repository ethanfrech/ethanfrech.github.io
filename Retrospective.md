- Were you able to get the entire project done?

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs that you have in your
code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code
doesn't have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used outside of the textbook or
course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed that you didn't use google at all.
Be safe CITE!

## Experience

Overall this was an interesting series of labs. I'm working with TypeScript in my senior design project currently
so it's nice to have some additional exposure in this class. I've been able to apply some of the knowledge I came
across when writing my own small tutorial. The lack of types in JavaScript has always frustrated me, it allows for a
great deal of creativity and "getting away with things", but I prefer the structure and order that types provide in the 
development process. I was able to get the module import and the jest tests working for testing the assigned "hello world"
demo. The text switching has not been consistent on the github.io hosting platform.

## Known issues or Bugs

The text switching on the "Try Me!" button for the "hello world" demo has not been consistent on the github.io hosting platform.
It has worked consitently on my local server however.

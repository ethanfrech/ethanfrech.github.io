            <h2>The Selling Points</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Static type-checking</h3>
            <p>One of the primary draws of TypeScript is static type-checking. JavaScript does not have static
                type-checking, which means there is no
                indication of the presence of a type-error in the code besides the manifestation of a bug at run time or
                other unexpected behavior. If you try to
                call an integer as a function in JavaScript it won't complain, but if you try to do the same thing with
                TypeScript will provide an error before code is run.
                This saves developers from spending time debugging due to type based errors.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Non-exception Failures</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript will throw errors when accessing properties on objects that don't exist,
                typos, uncalled functions, basic logic errors, and a slew of other common sense errors that
                JavaScript does not complain about until runtime. Instead of delivering exceptions or "undefined"
                TypeScript throws errors when it detects defects in the code structure.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Types for Tooling</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript has other mechanisms of error preventions other error messages. TypeScript's type-checker can
                assess whether or not the correct properties or variables are being accessed.
                Based on this information TypeScript can suggest the attributes you are trying to access based on the
                object and suggest them within the code editor. If the editor supports TypeScript this means
                that the user will be provided with possible "quick-fixes" for detected errors as well as pertinent
                useful navigation tools.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>tsc, the TypeScript compiler</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript uses a compiler named tsc. tsc is where the type-checking occurs. If there are any issues
                with a
                TypeScript file (.ts) tsc will provide comprehensive and concise errors. The
                good the compiler will return a plain JavaScript file. tsc will do its best to deliver "clean readable
                code"
                that looks human made.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Emitting with Errors</h3>
                <p>
                    Even if tsc throws an error it will still return the TypeScript file as a plain JavaScript file. It
                    will make you aware then proceed anyway, leaving fixing or leaving it at the users discretion.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Explicit Types</h3>
                <p>
                    By typing annotations within functions the user can specify what type each contained property is
                    supposed to be. Based on this information TypeScript will throw an error if it finds code that
                    assigns data of wrong type to an incompatible property. For example if a property was annoted as
                    type String but is provided data with a type Integer. It is not required to specify types for each
                    property, only when the user decided too.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Erased Types</h3>
                <p>
                    When you compile TypeScript into JavaScript with tsc the type annotations are completely removed.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Strictness</h3>
                <p>
                    In some cases TypeScript is most useful when only used to validate certain parts of the
                    programming. A use can specify where in their program they would like to use type-checking and
                    at what level of "strictness". Strictness can be all or nothing, or anything between based on user
                    specification.
                    Of course it is possible to create an entire project using strict TypeScript type-checking. A user
                    can also toggle individual checks, most commonly noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks are toggled.
                    noImplicityAny warns the user to specify types, which is the whole point of TypeScript.
                    strictNullChecks warns based on whether or not the user has handled null or undefined in their
                    functions.

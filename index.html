            <h2>The Selling Points</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Static type-checking</h3>
            <p>One of the primary draws of TypeScript is static type-checking. JavaScript does not have static
                type-checking, which means there is no
                indication of the presence of a type-error in the code besides the manifestation of a bug at run time or
                other unexpected behavior. If you try to
                call an integer as a function in JavaScript it won't complain, but if you try to do the same thing with
                TypeScript will provide an error before code is run.
                This saves developers from spending time debugging due to type based errors.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Non-exception Failures</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript will throw errors when accessing properties on objects that don't exist,
                typos, uncalled functions, basic logic errors, and a slew of other common sense errors that
                JavaScript does not complain about until runtime. Instead of delivering exceptions or "undefined"
                TypeScript throws errors when it detects defects in the code structure.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Types for Tooling</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript has other mechanisms of error preventions other error messages. TypeScript's type-checker can
                assess whether or not the correct properties or variables are being accessed.
                Based on this information TypeScript can suggest the attributes you are trying to access based on the
                object and suggest them within the code editor. If the editor supports TypeScript this means
                that the user will be provided with possible "quick-fixes" for detected errors as well as pertinent
                useful navigation tools.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>tsc, the TypeScript compiler</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript uses a compiler named tsc. tsc is where the type-checking occurs. If there are any issues
                with a
                TypeScript file (.ts) tsc will provide comprehensive and concise errors. The
                good the compiler will return a plain JavaScript file. tsc will do its best to deliver "clean readable
                code"
                that looks human made.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Emitting with Errors</h3>
                <p>
                    Even if tsc throws an error it will still return the TypeScript file as a plain JavaScript file. It
                    will make you aware then proceed anyway, leaving fixing or leaving it at the users discretion.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Explicit Types</h3>
                <p>
                    By typing annotations within functions the user can specify what type each contained property is
                    supposed to be. Based on this information TypeScript will throw an error if it finds code that
                    assigns data of wrong type to an incompatible property. For example if a property was annoted as
                    type String but is provided data with a type Integer. It is not required to specify types for each
                    property, only when the user decided too.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Erased Types</h3>
                <p>
                    When you compile TypeScript into JavaScript with tsc the type annotations are completely removed.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Strictness</h3>
                <p>
                    In some cases TypeScript is most useful when only used to validate certain parts of the
                    programming. A use can specify where in their program they would like to use type-checking and
                    at what level of "strictness". Strictness can be all or nothing, or anything between based on user
                    specification.
                    Of course it is possible to create an entire project using strict TypeScript type-checking. A user
                    can also toggle individual checks, most commonly noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks are toggled.
                    noImplicityAny warns the user to specify types, which is the whole point of TypeScript.
                    strictNullChecks warns based on whether or not the user has handled null or undefined in their
                    functions.

            <h2>Transitioning from JavaScript to Typescript</h2>
            <h3>Setting up your Directories</h3>
            <p>When setting up a TypeScript project it is important to separate your input .ts files from
                the output path/directory. If the files are intermingled compiling with tcs runs the risk of overwriting
                existing files. This also comes into play with bundling and transpiling.
            </p>
            <h3>Writing a Configuration File</h3>
            <p>TypeScript uses a file called tsconfig.json to define specifications and options for your project.
                This configuration file can determine things such as file inclusions and exclusions, whether or not pure
                JavaScript is allowed, and even
                use older versions of JavaScript for the output.
            </p>
            <h3>Integrating with Build Tools</h3>
            <p>You can use tools such as Gulp and Webpack with TypeScript. Gulp can be used to implement many other
                popular build tools. Webpack can be used with a feature of Typescript called ts-loader in conjunction
                with another feature called
                source-map-loader. This allows for easier live previews and debugging. Wepack requires its own
                configuration file, but this time its JavaScript
                instead of JSON.
            </p>
            <h3>Moving to TypeScript Files</h3>
            <p>To utilize TypeScript you must change the file extension of your files from .js to .ts. If you are using
                .jsx files you need to change them to tsc. It is likely you will encounter warnings, but the TypeScript
                compiler will still compile your code.
                You can adjust the settings to force you to fix all warnings before compilation, however it is likely
                that many of these warning
            <h3>Weeding out Errors</h3>
            <p>Most of the errors you will need to deal with initially are due to the lack of TypeScript syntax. You
                need to go through your code and refractor where
                TypeScript syntax should be used.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers</h2>
            <h3>Types by Inference</h3>
            <p>TypeScript will in most cases generate types based of your code(variable instantiation and assignment in
                particular). The core functionality that TypeScript provides
                is adding Types to JavaScript. This helps mitigate the hard to spot bugs that plague JavaScript as a
                result of the open ended 'any' type that applies to everything.
            </p>
            <h3>Defining Types</h3>
            <p>In some cases it is better to tell TypeScript what a data type should be as opposed to having it guess.
                This is achievable for writing an
                interface for your objects and functions that define types.
            </p>
            <h3>Composing Types</h3>
            <p>You can also specify a range of types that something can be. This is essentially just enumeration for
                literal values that an object or object attribute is allowed to be</p>
            <h3>Structural Type System</h3>
            <p>If two objects have the same shape they are perceived by the compiler of being of the same type.
                While a variable may never be assigned an explicit type definition the shape of
                the equivalent object will be used.
